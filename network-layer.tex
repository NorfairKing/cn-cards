\layer{Network}

\begin{card}{Packet}
\item The unit of data in a network layer.
\end{card}

\begin{card}{Routing}
\item The process of deciding in which direction to send traffic.
\item Network wide
\end{card}

\begin{card}{Forwarding}
\item The process of sending a packet on its way.
\end{card}

\begin{card}[Internet Protocol]{IP}
\TODO
\end{card}

\begin{card}{Datagram Model}
\item Each datagram contains a destination address.
\item No setup needed.
\item Router state: per destination
\item Routing: per packet
\item Failures are easy to mask
\item Hard to add quality of service
\end{card}

\begin{card}{Virtual Circuit Model}
\item Don't contain destination address, just labels.
\item Setup needed
\item Router state: per connection
\item Routing: per circuit
\item Failures are not easy to mask
\item Easy to add quality of service
\end{card}

\begin{card}[Multiple Protocol Label Switching]{MPLS}
\TODO
\end{card}

\begin{card}[Time To Live]{TTL}
\item Decremented with every router hop.
\item Throws ICMP error if ever hits zero.
\end{card}

\begin{card}{Longest matching prefix}
\TODO
\end{card}

\begin{card}[Maximum Transmission Unit]{MTU}
\item The largest packet which will fit through this network.
\end{card}

\begin{card}{IP packet fragmentation}
\item Necessary because the entire packet might not fit into a frame.
\item Drawbacks:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Increases the processing load on routers that have to fragment a packet.
        \item Decreases the probability of an entire packet being received.
    \end{itemize}
\item Alternatives: MTU discovery
\end{card}

\begin{card}[Internet Control Message Protocol]{ICMP}
\item Reports packet forwarding errors to sender.
\item On top of IP
\item Used in MTU discovery (destination unreachable due to fragmentation)
\end{card}

\begin{card}{IPV4}
\item 32 bit addresses
\end{card}

\begin{card}{IPV6}
\item 128 bit addresses
\end{card}

\begin{card}{Middlebox}
\item Advantages: Control over many hosts and possible rapid deployment.
\item Disadvantages: breaking layering interferes with connectivity and poor vantage point for tasks.
\end{card}

\begin{card}[Network Address Translation]{NAT}
\item Is a middlebox.
\item Connects an internal network to an external network.
\item Motivated by ipv4 address scarcity.
\item Makes ISP think that hosts are just different (TCP) ports on one IP address by rewriting IP headers.
\item Advantages: partially solves the IP address scarcity problem
\item Disadvantages: doesn't work on connectionless protocols (UDP), breaks apps that expose IP adresses (FTP)
\end{card}
