\begin{card}{Rate}
\item A measure of the speed by which bits are transferred across a channel
\item Measured in $bps$
\end{card}


\begin{card}{Latency}
\item Latency is the combination of transmission delay and propagation delay.
\item transmission delay = time to put an $n$ bit message on the channel: $n/rate$
\item propagation delay = time for signal to propagate across the channel: $n/speed$
\item Measured in seconds
\end{card}

\begin{card}{Bandwidth-Delay}
\item A measure for the amount of data in flight.
\item Calculated as $rate \times delay$.
\item Measured in bits
\end{card}

\begin{card}{Bandwidth}
\item Electrical engineering definition: width of frequency band
\item Computer science definition: information carrying capacity: $bits/sec$
\end{card}

\full{Round Trip Time}
\begin{card}{RTT}
\item The time it takes for a response to arrive.
\item Computed as $2\times delay$.
\end{card}

\full{Signal to Noise Ratio}
\begin{card}{SNR}
\item A measure for how efficient a signal is at carrying information.
\item Computed as $(signal + noise)/signal$
\end{card}

\full{}
\begin{card}{Hub}
\item Also called a repeater.
\item Forwards any incoming signal to all the other ports.
\item Equivalent to linking up all the nodes on one line.
\end{card}
