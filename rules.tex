\section*{How to play the game}


\subsection*{Putting together the game}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Print out the game.
\item Glue together the pages two by two, back to back.
\item Cut out the individual cards.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Preparation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Shuffle the cards
\item Put the cards info-down on the table in one pile.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Playing the game}
The game is turn-based and is played with at least two people.
The player who can list the network layers the fastest, from top to bottom and back up, gets the first turn.
In player $A$'s turn:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Player $B$ picks a card from the deck and shows the side without the full information to player $A$.
\item Player $B$ selects (by choice) one of the bullet points on the card (or the layer of the card).
\item Player $B$ asks player $A$ a question about that specific bullet point (or asks which layer the card belongs to)
\item If player $A$ answers correctly, player $A$ gets the card, otherwise the card is put underneath the pile again. (If player $B$ asks about the layer and $A$ cannot answer correctly, player $B$ gets the card.)
\item The next player gets the turn. 
\end{enumerate}
The game ends when the first player has a card from each layer.
